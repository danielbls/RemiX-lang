# RemiX-lang
Better than Greg's language because this one exists.
This language follows the C# syntax, but will be much easier to use.

### Getting Started
```
namespace RemiX
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            println("*RemiX is here!");
        }
    }
}
```

More to come soon.
